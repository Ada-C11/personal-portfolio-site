            <h3>Hotel</h3>

            <p>One project I got a lot of value out of was "Hotel." We were tasked with writing a program that could be used to create ang keep track of the reservations for a 20-room hotel. In the initial phase we put our newly-acquired knowledge of classes to use, including modules, instance variables, instance methods, and class methods.</p>

            <p>While learning how to write Ruby code, we were also learning about Agile and Object Oriented Design practices. So, after getting the hotel code working, we were tasked with refactoring to acheive a design. I was excited for this opportunity! I reviewed my code and realized it was tightly-coupled in a few places. I took the time to move some functions into another class and wrap them in methods.</p>

            <p> I finished this project with a sense of satisfaction, having synthesized all of the learning concepts we'd been intensely working to understand for the past two months.</p>

            <p>Until recently, I made videos for a living. Here's one I did for a friend (Daniel Miles, the one with the epic beard), mostly for fun.</p>
