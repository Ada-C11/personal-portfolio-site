                        <h3>Startrly</h3>
                        <p>Startrly was a design product, where I created a webpage that matched a provided wireframe.</p> 
                        <p>This introductory project into HTML and CSS allowed me to practice layout techniques (including CSS Grid and Flexbox)while working on producing DRY and readable CSS code by using various selectors.</p>

                        <h3>Hotel</h3>
                        <p>In Hotel, I built the codebase for a booking system for a small hotel.</p>
                        <p>Hotel was a cultimation project, in which I was able to use all that I have learned into a single project.  The project required objected-oriented design and following TDD principles.</p>
                        <p>Following the completion of this project, I also had the opportunity to refactor my code following a code review.</p>

                        <p>Grocery Store was a project designed to simulate a grocery store system where orders and customers are tracked.</p>
                        <p>In grocery store, I used Test-Driven-Development to write my code.  In my project, I incorporated data from a CSV file, used instance variables and methods as well as object composition.</p>

                        <p>A project that allowed the user to build a solar system model via the command line.</p>
                        <p>In this project, I worked on creating classes, corresponding methods, and code to allow the user to interact with the classes. With this code, I was working applying the Single Responsibility Principle to my classes.</p>

                        <p>A project where I created codebase that stored and used data on riders, drivers, and trips.</p>
                        <p>On this project, I worked creating nested data structures and understanding the logic to obtain the pieces of data in the nested structures while also working on iterating through the nested structures.</p>

                        <p>In Portmanteau Generator, I created a CLI that generated partmanteaus based on user input.</p>
                        <p>In writing this code, I used conditional logic and loops.  I also worked on creating methods and variables and modifying variables.</p>

                        <h3>Slack CLI</h3>
                        <p>Slack CLI was a project where we created a CLI that allowed the user to interact with the application Slack by posting messages and reviewing channels and users for a workspace.</p>
                        <p>Using TDD, we created a program that was able to send and receive responses from the Slack API.  In our testing, we employed VCR to mock an external dependency.</p>

                        <p>Revisiting Ride Share, this implementation was object-oriented and included classes, methods and attributes.</p>
                        <p>Using TDD, this project reinforced creating classes with attributes, using composition to connect classes, and working with large amounts of data.</p>

                        <h3>Adagrams</h3>
                        <p>Adagrams was a command line game where drawn letters are used to spell words.  Each letter corresponded to a particular score and the highest final score was the winner.</p>
                        <p>The program required methods that were able to declare, read, and manipulate data.  This was the first project I completed using pair programming.</p>
