                <h2>Personal Journey:</h2>
                <p>I didn't always know that I wanted to be a programmer.  I did, however, know that I loved the thrill of a challenge and the excitement that came with success.  Initially, I pursued this through science, choosing to study Biochemistry at Seattle University.  Through my classes, I got a small taste of programming.  In Calculus, we used applications like Matlab and Mathematica that showed me how excuriatingly picky programming can be.  But, it also showed me how powerful it can be, evaluating integrals that could simply not be done by hand.</p>
                <p>My understanding of programming and its power increased as I got further into my science classes.  Although I was still using applications others had built, I was able to use programs to do things like model complex protein structures and evaluate NMR data.  This interest in programming was furthered by my independent research project, where I modeled synergy in HIV prevention.  I still had not learned to create my own programs, but by creating functions within Excel and Prism, I was able to begin analyzing large amounts of data to predict synergistic combinations of different HIV drugs that when used in combination would increase overall efficacy in preventing HIV contraction.</p>
                <p>While pursuing my science degree, I fell in love philosophy, having had the fortune to be required to take an introductory philosophy class as part of my core cirriculum.  After two classes, I decided to add a philosophy major, specializing in analytic philosophy and logic.  I believe that, in particular, studying advanced logic, helped to develop my interest in programming.  In my logic classes, like in my science class, I found challenge and felt rewarded when I solved a particularly difficult problem.  The introduction of modal logic, in which there was now a distinction between necessity and possibility made it even more exciting.  Modal logic, similarly to how I view programming, had a very distinct set of rules--but how you applied those rules where up to you.</p>
                <p>Although I gained interest in programming during college, I didn't actively try 'Programming' until I had already finished college.  Programming (with a capital 'P') started as a hobby by working through Python the Hard Way.  It was after I heard about Ada that I seriously began to consider what it would mean to be a Programmer...</p>

                <h2>Life at Ada:</h2>
                <p>Adaâ€™s vision really resonated with me.  I wanted to join Ada Developers Academy because I wanted to be part of a community of strong, diverse people, with whom I can navigate the fascinating, world-changing, technology industry.</p>
                <p>Admittedly, my first week, particularly the first day, at Ada was terrifying.  During the first meeting of the cohort, I remember sitting in auditorium, surrounded with 47 amazing folks, thinking, "What am I doing here?"  I was terrified that I had somehow slipped through the application, and that I would quickly prove that I did not belong.  I was temporarily calmed by Devin.  We were discussing community and one aspect of community being there is a vetting process; you have to be invited into the community.  At this point, Devin pointed out that we were all vetted into the Ada community and that only awesome people that deserve to be here get in.  If we were sitting there, then we deserved to be there.  Even though it was directed to the group as a whole, it was particularly poignant to me and allowed me to feel like even if I personally didn't feel like I belong, others did.  As the days went on, I found the voice telling me I didn't belong shrinking.  I was doing well and receiving positive feedback.  Plus, it was not like I had much freetime to spend in doubt. </p>
                <p>The lectures have been interesting and I'm really enjoying learning more about programming.  We had a lecture on truth tables and while I was initially excited to revisit something that I studied during my undergrad, it was much more satisfying to be able to apply it to my code rather than just completing the tables with pen and paper.</p>
                <p>I will say that I still have some fears and doubts about difficulty of the program as we continue and life after Ada (getting a job, being a good programmer, etc), but it is getting easier to focus more and more on just learning as much as I can!  Overall, I can't believe how lucky I am that I get to struggle with these problems every day.</p>
