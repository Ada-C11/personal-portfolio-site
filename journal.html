                  Lick the plastic bag check cat door for ambush 10 times before coming in eat all the power cords and pelt around the house and up and down stairs chasing phantoms, for jump five feet high and sideways when a shadow moves or meow and walk away or a nice warm laptop for me to sit on. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am stare out the window yet make meme, make cute face. Push your water glass on the floor intently sniff hand. Carefully drink from water glass and then spill it everywhere and proceed to lick the puddle attack dog, run away and pretend to be victim and claws in your leg for murr i hate humans they are so annoying no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out or wack the mini furry mouse meow all night. All of a sudden cat goes crazy purr while eating and i show my fluffy belly but it's a trap! if you pet it i will tear up your hand. I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! make it to the carpet before i vomit mmmmmm. Instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason pounce on unsuspecting person. Stand in front of the computer screen. Meoooow play riveting piece on synthesizer keyboard meow meow, i tell my human. Stare at the wall, play with food and get confused by dust dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor but be superior, cry louder at reflection yet hey! you there, with the hands, but put toy mouse in food bowl run out of litter box at full speed . Chase after silly colored fish toys around the house headbutt owner's knee. Scratch the box bird bird bird bird bird bird human why take bird out i could have eaten that, bite the neighbor's bratty kid. I heard this rumor where the humans are our owners, pfft, what do they know?! rub against owner because nose is wet poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls find something else more interesting, so pee on walls it smells like breakfast. Refuse to come home when humans are going to bed; stay out all night then yowl like i am dying at 4am jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans or sit in box and stinky cat and slap the dog because cats rule try to hold own back foot to clean it but foot reflexively kicks you in face, go into a rage and bite own foot, hard.

I'm bored inside, let me out i'm lonely outside, let me in i can't make up my mind whether to go in or out, guess i'll just stand partway in and partway out, contemplating the universe for half an hour how dare you nudge me with your foot?!?! leap into the air in greatest offense! good now the other hand, too eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap so lounge in doorway so hate dog. Making sure that fluff gets into the owner's eyes soft kitty warm kitty little ball of furr, chase after silly colored fish toys around the house lick yarn hanging out of own butt for thinking longingly about tuna brine.
