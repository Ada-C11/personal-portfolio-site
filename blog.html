      <h2>This week at Ada</h2>

        <p>Learning HTML and CSS isn’t what it used to be.</p>

        <p>The first time I tried to learn these was back in 2014, and although I didn’t hold strong feelings against CSS, I certainly remember spending more time than I would like to admit just trying to align elements on a page.</p>
        
        <p>That is why this past week at Ada was filled with pleasant surprises as I learned about the new and improved versions of HTML and CSS. How did people ever create full websites from scratch without grids and flexbox???</p>
        
        <p>My first reaction to learning grids was to think that I would only ever want to use flexbox, but that quickly changed after I realized what a convenient tool this is, especially when used together with flexbox. The trick seems to be using grid to structure the overall page, and then applying flexbox to the smaller bits.</p>
        
        <p>Here are a few fun and effective resources to get some practice with these functionalities:</p>
