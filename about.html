                <h3>my life</h3>
                <p>
                i was born in ulsan, south korea with the name 신장민 (shin jungmin).  my parents decided in order for us to succeed, we needed to move to america.  we immigrated to spokane, washington and i became mina shin.  of all places, how did we end up in spokane??  my uncle found his way to spokane from toronto > boston and by the time our family was ready to come to the states, he had settled in spokane.  i moved to seattle, washington to attend uw (go huskies!!) and i have never left.  i can't help but wonder how different would my life and would i be if we never left korea, ended up in toronto or boston?
