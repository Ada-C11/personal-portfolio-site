                <p>Hi there, my name is Alex (she/her) and I am currently attending <a href="#">Ada Developers Academy</a> to become a software developer! I graduated from the University of Washington in 2017 where I got my Bachelor of Science in Microbiology. I realized soon after starting my first job after college that it wasn't the field I wanted to have a career in. After spending some time trying to figure out what exactly I wanted to do with my life, a friend suggested I look into coding - and I never went back! </p>
                <p>I am currently a couple months into Ada and while it is incredibly challenging, I have never learned so quicly in my life and absolutely know I made the right decision. We have so far learned Ruby and HTML/CSS, and will next delve into Ruby on Rails and Javascript. If you want to see some of the projects I've worked on while at Ada, feel free to check out my <a href="#">GitHub</a>. In August I will begin a five month-long  internship at a tech company here in Seattle! </p>
                <p>I currently live in a tiny apartment in Seattle with my boyfriend and a growing collection of plants. When I am not studying or coding, I am checking out local breweries, knitting, going down YouTube rabbit holes, and tending to my plant babies!</p>
