                        <div> 
                            <p>I was born and raised in San Diego, California. Growing up as a first-generation, low-income, child of immigrants, education
                            was drilled into me as the means to "success". I attended UC Berkeley and obtained a B.S. and M.S. in civil engineering. I focused
                            on geotechnical engineering and worked for a couple years after graduate school as a geotechnical engineering consultant. I decided to pursue a PhD
                            in Geotechnical Earthquake Engineering at UW in 2014, and have been studying soil-structure-interaction during earthquake shaking since. It is still
                            in progress as I pursue software development at Ada.</p>
