        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>
            I'm Shubha Rajan (pronounced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KaNnA7ljwg">ʃʊbʱaː</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxYg0HUeg1A">raːdʒən</a>) I use <a href="http://pronoun.is/she?or=they">"she" and "they"</a> pronouns.</h3>
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm a software-engineer-in-training, writer, designer, educator and Americorps Alum. I'm from Southern California, but I currently live in Seattle, WA and attend <a href="https://www.adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> full-time. I also volunteer at <a href="https://seattlemakers.org/">Seattle Makers</a> where I help members troubleshoot machines and work on shop projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also am part of <a href="https://freerads.org/">Free Radicals</a>, an activist collective of scientists that aims to hold STEM institutions accountable for damage they cause to marginalized communities. I previously helped FreeRads revamp their website and am currently collaborating on creating a Radical Science education toolkit.

            I am passionate about promoting creativity and new ideas, as well as connecting innovative ideas and resources with those who need them the most. 
        </p>

            Things I do other than work:
                <ul>
                    <li>Write comedy for the stage and occasionally perform.</li>
                    <li>Make my own board games and one-page-one-shot RPGs (think D&D but way shorter and sillier).</li>
                    <li>Take pictures with my trusty Nikon.</li>
                </ul>
        </p>
