      <h2>About me</h2>
      <article>
          <p>Why didn’t I get into software development sooner? It checks so many boxes for me: it’s challenging, 
            collaborative, the applications are endless, and it rewards both my logical and my social sides. 
            The lack of diversity in this field repelled me for a long time, but the opportunity to join the 
            unique environment of Ada combined with the shrinking job market for translators gave me the 
            extra push I needed.</p>

          <p>But I am also happy for the experience I bring from my life before Ada. I graduated in 
            International Relations from one of the top universities in Brazil and went on to work at 
            the national transportation department in my country, where I helped build connections between 
            members of Congress and technical experts.</p>
          
          <p>When I left Brazil, I spent some time exploring the field of technical communication, 
            which was when I had my first taste of programming languages. I was hooked, but I had to set this 
            interest aside for about three years as I worked with software localization, testing, and translation 
            while pursuing a certificate in translation from the University of Toronto - Extension.</p>
          
          <p>As for life after Ada, <strong>I would love to work on logistics issues, improve developer's workflow, 
              write awesome documentation, and help bring more folks from diverse backgrounds into tech.</strong></p>
