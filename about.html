            <h1>a little about me</h1>
            <p>
                My interest in software development started during a 5 year stint of being customer facing at several Seattle based technology companies. 
                I was able to experience the best and the worst of program design via my customers and was driven by the desire to improve the 
                quality of code the end user interacts with.
            </p>
            <p>
                This path initially pointed me toward quality assurance and testing. I pursued the Software Test Engineering certificate at Bellevue College 
                in 2018 and learned many new skills including how to use Selenium to automate UI testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                While learning how to write automation tests, I realized that I really enjoyed writing code. Several months later I applied and was accepted 
                to Ada Developers Academy. And that brings us up to date. I learn a new skill everyday and am loving every minute of it.
