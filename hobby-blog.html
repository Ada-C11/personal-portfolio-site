                <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019/04/08/the-challenge-of-going-off-psychiatric-drugs">New Yorker Article "The Challenge of Going Off Psychiatric Drugs"</a>
                <div class="quotes">
                    <p>“She experienced what John Teasdale, a research psychologist at the University of Oxford, named “depression about depression.” She interpreted each moment of lethargy or disappointment as the start of a black mood that would never end. Psychiatric diagnoses can ensnare people in circular explanations: they are depressed because they are depressed.”</p>
                    <p>Whitaker told me that Laura reminded him of many young people who had contacted him after reading the book. He said, “They’d been prescribed one drug, and then a second, and a third, and they are put on this other trajectory where their self-identity changes from being normal to abnormal—they are told that, basically, there is something wrong with their brain, and it isn’t temporary—and it changes their sense of resilience and the way they present themselves to others.”</p>
                    <p>As Jonathan Metzl writes, in “Prozac on the Couch,” S.S.R.I.s were marketed especially to female consumers, as drugs that would empower them at work while preserving the kind of feminine traits required at home. One advertisement for Zoloft showed a woman in a pants suit, holding the hands of her two children, her wedding ring prominent, next to the phrase “Power That Speaks Softly.” Today, antidepressants are taken by one in five white American women.</p>

                <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/04/could-woman-walk-around-world-today/">National Geographic "Why It's Still Difficult for Women to Travel the World"</a>
                <div class="quotes">
                    <p>“Those who have been unable to walk out as far as their feet would take them have been denied not merely exercise or recreation but a vast portion of their humanity,”</p>
                    <p>Women have always been plagued by the pseudoscientific belief that the female body is not equipped for movement. “The belief that women walk worse is widespread throughout the literature of human evolution,” writes Rebecca Solnit in Wanderlust, her extraordinarily comprehensive book on the history of walking. The female body is a spectacle, designed to be looked at; or a single-use item, designed for childbirth; or a weakness, lacking in masculine strength and virility. The male body, on the other hand, is simply neutral—an assumed state of being.</p>
                    <p>What sort of person must one be to walk the world? To go after the horizon, day after day? For Paul, it has taken decades of industry and experience, institutional support, relative freedom from domestic life, and enough dissatisfaction with the status quo to embark on something radically different—among countless other things. (He would add: an endless supply of knee cartilage.) I would add: confidence. Confidence, earned or not, is a tremendous power. While no one is immune to self-doubt (no sane person, anyway), men have been far better able to acquire this skill. And it is a skill—giving oneself permission to speak with authority, to be heard, to disagree—learned through education, maturity, and professional training. Men are more likely to receive the approval of family and peers and to study and work at established institutions.</p>
