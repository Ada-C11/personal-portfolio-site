              <p>I don't know about you guys, but I certainly didn't know a thing about computer science when I walked into Ada. I had barely figured out how to turn my MacBook Air on (and sometimes I don't even get that right). Some of my classmates are more fortunate. They've written apps, had GitHub accounts for more than a few short months, and have even worked in the industry! So my question is this: Which rocks were you guys looking under to find so much experience? And are there anymore rocks?
