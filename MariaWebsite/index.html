    <p class="about">Hi there! My name is Maria<br></br>
      This is my first static html design, yay! So I figure I have to tell you a little about myself:
      Since I was little I always enjoyed making thigs, from dirt cakes, to apartments for my toys made out 
      of cereal boxes, nothing was better than makig my own stuffed animals out of recycled fabrics, the freedom 
      to design is something that captures my curiosity.<br><br>
      I majored in arquitecture at UNAM in Mexico City, where I receieved an scholarship to continue my studies at 
      Virginia Tech, later on I moved to Seattle where I had the opportunity to develop skills for translating and 
      interpreting, I guess all that just brought me closer to the structure of language, and here I am learning how to code!<br></br> 
      On my free time, I enjoy traveling and learning from everything and everyone, I still keep an eye for sketching here 
      and there and photography, I guess my inner architect follows me when it comes to shapes, light and colors and the aesthetic 
      of nature itself never stops to amaze me
