                  <p>I picked up bass guitar a four years ago as a means to bolster a creative outlet for myself. Little did I know that my plunge into this instrument would change my life!</p>
                  <p>Shortly after buying an old MusicMan Ray 34, I started trying to learn my first song: "All Good In the Hood". Beastly funk tune by early 2000's maverick Jamiroquai. I'll never forget the slow and gradual feeling of developing right and left hand finger strength and then being able to play along with songs. The massive sense of accomplishment I felt was palpable. But naturally, I wanted more.</p>
                  <p>Arpeggios, chromatic runs, string skipping...I just had to learn how to do it all! I would sit for hours a day practicing, sometimes playing the same song many times over just to build my chops. Routine in music is key to building skill. A bountiful amount of painful blisters later, I'm not even close to being where I want to be. Being a musician is a never-ending journey. There's always more to learn and explore!</p>
