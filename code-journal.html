      <h3>anotha one</h3>
      <p>Hey hey hey, did you miss me?</p>
      <p>Long time no see, I know. Big news since we last caught up:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Applied for Ada again</li>
        <li>Got in</li>
        <li>Moved to Seattle</li>
        <li>Learned Ruby</li>
        <li>Took a much-needed week off</li>
        <li>Finished HTML/CSS week at Ada</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Which brings me here! Remember all those coding tutorials where we
        finished off with a personal portfolio project? That was also our weekend project
        at Ada. So, voila, a new site. Now, back in the day (read: 10 months ago),
        I was making that last website with Bootstrap. No Bootstrap here --
        learned CSS Grid and Flexbox, which are cool.
      </p>
      <p>This very sophisticated site was
        inspired by... a roller rink? Idk, don't ask me. But color blocks
        are fun and hip in the year 2019 right? Right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Anywhoo, didn't use any of the code from the old site except the articles
        you see on this page. It's weird to look back and see where I was less
        than a year ago, and think about where I'll be less than a year from now.

      <p>Life is crazy y'all.</p>

      <h3>...and we're live (?!)</h3>
      <p>Confession: I have no idea what I'm doing!
        But we're here, and that's
        something. In the courses I've done online, I haven't actually
        learned file management in any meaningful way, or really how to
        create a website beyond just the HTML/CSS bit. I somehow found my file
        manager in CPanel through GoDaddy (is that even how I'm supposed to be
        doing this? who knows), deleted the Wordpress files (because that's
        what the internet told me to do), deleted the theoretical Wordpress
        database in MySQL (I'm really looking forward to reading this post in a
        few months and laughing at my own ignorance), and uploading the files I
        had started putting together on my computer into that file manager. And,
        voila! My self-made website is live! Is it bad that I didn't really expect
        this to work? I wouldn't be surprised if it all blows up in a few hours
        (y'all, is the internet this simple? why have I been doing up until
        now?)</p>
      <p>I know it's just the beginning, but I'm really loving this whole
        DIY approach. With Wordpress, I was being coddled. Now I <em>actually</em>
        need to learn about the web (seriously, I thought that's what I had been
        doing this whole time...), understand best practices, really know how to do
        front end, and at least get the basics of the back end (I'm not
        a huge fan of listening to the internet's advice without understanding it,
        like I did when I deleted those Wordpress files/database.) Unlike before,
        I have context now to understand those things and to experiment with
        them with my own two hands. So watch out, world! WE'RE LIVE.</p>
      <p>P.S. If you're reading this and have any advice whatsoever on how
        to internet or what I'm already doing wrong or what I could be
        doing much better (remember, we just came to terms with the face that
        I'm starting from the bottom here),

        you!!</p>

      <h3>"jeez jess, stop living in the 90's"</h3>
      <p>Hey, a new website! Up until now, this blog was on Wordpress. It
        was pretty. It had a lot of functionality. I could easily control
        the back-end and front-end to make it look and act how I wanted it
        to with just a few clicks.
        But here's the thing: I'm learning web dev, but in my own website, I
        wasn't applying any of my knowledge. Maybe I should actually do
        some web dev? It's been fun building this site with the knowledge that I
        do have already, and it'll be a cool way to apply better practices and new
        features as I learn them (especially once I start playing with JavaScript).
      </p>
      <p>I have some catching up to do on these interwebs, though. So, for
        now, I'm giving myself permission to live in the 90's. My website doesn't
        need to look like the top sites on the web. It's not going to be
        perfect. It might not even be "good," by any real standards. And I'm
        embracing it! I just have a few basic rules for myself:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>I must fully understand everything I am putting in my code.</strong> No
          using a suggestion I found online that I don't completely grasp
          (a) why that solution works and (b) why that solution is best for
          me.</li>
        <li><strong>No copy and pasting.</strong> Anything I don't generate completely on
          my own (even once I've gotten myself to the point where I fully
          understand it) must be typed character-for-character -- I gotta get
          familiar with it! Even then, I will cite the source in the
          comments.</li>
        <li><strong>It's okay to be bad.</strong> I'm a
          perfectionist at heart, and I tend to let myself get discouraged if
          things aren't just as they should be. It's okay, boo. You're going
          to be bad for a while. Don't let that stop you from doing it.</li>
        <li><strong>Always demand more of myself.</strong> The previous point doesn't
          give me permission to settle. If I encounter a problem, I should
          figure out how to fix it. If something doesn't look right,
          look into it. If I think of a feature that would be cool/useful to add,
          learn how to make it happen, and try it.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>All that to say... Welcome to the new site! It's going to be a fun
        ride, just you wait.</p>

      <h3>first taste of ruby</h3>
      <p>So, I started learning Ruby last week! I'd actually avoided it up
        until this point because I had read some blogs and articles and things
        that suggested against it, but I got invited to phase 2 of the Ada
        application and that involved a coding challenge in Ruby... so here I
        am. I haven't done back-end work in a few months ever since I paused
        CS50 and starting focusing on HTML/CSS. I didn't realize how much I'd
        missed it! I love the problem-solving. It's like a game to me.</p>
      <p>In CS50, I had made similar programs in C, so this felt
        conceptually familiar. Ruby is super straight-forward and high-level
        coming from C, which I'm sure I'll come to appreciate, but it was
        actually a hard transition to make. I do like the prospect of a
        shallow learning curve, though -- I'm going to continue playing
        around with Ruby and hopefully will be able to keep building skills
        and going deeper easier than I would have with C. The coding challenge
        helped me get a good grasp on arrays and hashes, and that foundation
        seems like a strong one to work off of from here on out.</p>
      <p>I also left the coding challenge with some pretty clear ideas of
        how I could improve my code, so even though it's already submitted,
        I think I'll spend the next few days going back and improving/building
        the program. I'd like to improve the flow control and add some
        additional features. I'm looking forward to the new and improved
        product.</p>

      <h3>good ol' textbooks</h3>
      <p>When I started learning web development, every resource I used was
        online. Heck, every resource you'd ever need is online; I don't doubt
        that. But there are other resources out there: ol' fashioned,
        no-computer-necessary resources.</p>
      <p>Maybe it's the fact that I was in school not more than a year ago,
        but after a few months of learning web dev, I kind of missed
        textbooks. Crazy, right? Something about the tangible, thorough, and
        easily reference-able medium stuck with me. I gotta be honest -- in
        college, I almost never read my textbooks. The irony's not lost on me.
        But I think the difference is this: in school, for the most part, I
        didn't particularly care to remember the information after the test
        date. Now, I'm trying to learn something that I really want to hold
        on to, that I want to be able to apply for years to come.</p>
      <p>So I'm giving textbooks a try. I'm starting Jon
        Duckett's <i>HTML and CSS: Design and
          Build Websites</i>, then moving on to his JavaScript
        and <i>JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web
          Development</i>. I love the layout and the tone so far, and I'm looking
        forward to reading everything in the coming days and weeks.</p>
      <p>I think that, after these books, I'm going to move on from
        front-end. At least for now. I miss doing back-end work. I miss
        problem solving and creating small programs in C (which is the extent
        of back-end practice I've had so far). I'm excited for these
        textbooks, but in all honesty, I'm also excited to finish them and
        move on. I really do want to have a great understanding of front-end
        (hence the books), but I don't want to feel stuck.</p>
      <aside>For those non-traditional (read: not
        college majors/minors) programming students out there: have you used
        textbooks or other non-digital tools for learning? If so, which ones,
        and what did you think of them?</aside>

      <h3>applying for ada</h3>
      <aside>UPDATE JUNE 2018: Welp, I didn't get in!
        I made it through the first few rounds but didn't get offered a
        spot in this upcoming cohort. And that's okay. I feel capable and
        empowered to do this on my own. While it would've been a cool
        opportunity, it was never my goal in the first place to go to a
        bootcamp. I want to be in a
        frame of mind where I'm able to go after opportunities as they come up
        but not let those possibilities (or lack thereof) knock me off course.
        I also don't want to erase any part of this process, so my original post
        about applying is below.</aside>
      <p>So, I decided to take the leap! I applied for a bootcamp. Not just
        any ol' bootcamp, though -- none of them enticed me enough to want to
        apply vs. just teaching myself the old fashion way. But Ada... Ada's
        something different. I read the website and don't feel like I'm being
        advertised to. I actually believe in the mission of Ada: a bootcamp
        (well, development academy) just for women that encourages community
        and diversity. It sounds incredible. I first starting looking into
        the idea of bootcamps a few months ago, but I quickly dismissed most
        as too expensive and not well-rounded enough. (Did I mention too
        expensive?). This is the one I kept returning to. It just seemed to
        fit. Heck, I'd probably have applied for it even if it was expensive
        and completely unaffordable (which it's not, because if you get in,
        it's *free*. What?).</p>
      <p>Applying was hard. The application itself wasn't particularly
        difficult or strenuous, but I've realized that I struggle to put
        myself out there for things I really want. If it seems too good, too
        perfect, then I can't have it... right? It probably goes back to some
        deep-seated fear of failure. Well, that won't get me anywhere. I have
        to remind myself of what a teacher of mine used to say about
        auditions: "Someone has to get it. Why not you?" And it's true -- I
        believe I am capable of excelling in the program. I know I have so
        much to give and so much to learn, and I'd love the chance to prove
        that.</p>
      <p>I hesitated to write a post about applying for a few reasons.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>It's hard to go public about something you don't yet have. It's
          very possible that I won't get into the program and will have this
          post memorializing my lack of success. That's a vulnerable place
          to be.</li>
        <li>I did list this site as my personal website on my Ada
          application, and I don't want to write a post that seems like it's
          just written for whoever happens to review my application. (If
          that's you, hi! This isn't for you; it's for me. But thanks for
          checking my site out!)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then why did I write it?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If this blog is going to be about my journey, I need to include
          it all -- my hopes, failures, successes, dreams... each step. I want
          to be able to look back and see it all. I want to remember why I
          took the paths I took.</li>
        <li>Just like I don't want to write a post for a specific potential
          audience member, I don't want to NOT write a post because I'm afraid
          of how it will be perceived. That's silly.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the end, no matter what happens, I'm proud of myself for
        applying. I'm proud of myself for going after something I want, and
        as scary as it is to admit... I really want this. Eek!</p>

      <h2>February 16, 2018</h2>
      <h3>so far: a summary</h3>
      <p>Moving forward, my hope is to post about specific web dev topics as
        I learn about them. Before I do that, though, I wanted to explain what
        I've done so far in my learning journey. I promise that there will be
        more technical posts moving forward, but thanks for bearing with me
        so far!</p>
      <p><strong>In the past:</strong> Growing up, I
        occasionally played with code. I remember using Scratch and learning
        HTML in middle school, ultimately designing my own simple animations
        and web pages. Outside of school, I'd play with code in a casual way --
        nothing serious, but just for fun. It was always enjoyable to me. I
        remember, for example, spending one Christmas break working my way
        through CodeAcademy modules. In sum, I lightly dabbled for years.</p>
      <p><strong>The starting line:</strong> I decided
        I wanted to seriously learn web development a few months ago, towards
        the end of 2017. I graduated with a B.A. in the Spring and decided I
        wasn't done learning -- not by a long shot. College, for me, was a
        chance to learn about the world; it wasn't necessarily a direct
        professional development tool. Now, I have the chance to learn how to
        do what I love. Knowing I had enjoyed the small amount of coding I'd
        done in the past, I started to think about web development more
        seriously. The intersection of technology and design is exciting to me
        and merges different skill sets I've thoroughly enjoyed utilizing in
        separate ways. I appreciate the many customizable career paths that
        professionals in this area are able to pursue. The fact that this
        career innately involves a never-ending learning curve is right in my
        eternal-student wheelhouse. More than all of this, though, is the
        prospect of the learning journey itself: I know I can do it if I put
        my mind and energy towards it. Isn't that the most exciting type of
        challenge? It'll take a lot of hard work, but the payoff is
        guaranteed. It's not a lottery ticket or even a smart bet -- chance
        has no place here. How much I learn and how successful I am will be a
        direct result of my input. I am determined to improve myself, so I
        will. Simple as that.</p>
      <p><strong>CS50:</strong> Since I didn't have a
        Computer Science background outside a class or two in college, I
        wanted to start by building a firm foundation and understanding of
        the basics. After doing some research, I decided Harvard's CS50 course
        on edX was the best place for me to start. So far, I've worked through
        the first three weeks of content (I took a break to work on
        freeCodeCamp), but man was it an enlightening three weeks! The
        professor is an excellent instructor and I now have a thorough
        understanding of many key concepts I didn't previously know anything
        about in addition to having the satisfaction of completing some long
        and challenging problems sets coding in C. There's nothing like the
        feeling of having a perfectly functioning program after hours of
        coding and debugging. I plan to come back to CS50 later and hope to
        finish it in 2018.</p>
      <p><strong>freeCodeCamp:</strong> In the
        beginning of 2018, I decided to shift my current focus to
        freeCodeCamp. In terms of my goals, it made sense to start tackling
        front-end development before moving on to back-end. I've worked
        through the beginning of the Front End Development Certification
        (HTML5 and CSS, Responsive Design with Bootstrap, and jQuery) and
        completed the basic front-end projects. I took a brief hiatus to build
        this site, but I'm diving back in tomorrow. Next up is basic
        Javascript.</p>
      <p><strong>Other:</strong> There are some other
        ways I'm trying to learn web development alongside those listed above.
        I want to add some variety so I can balance the weaknesses and
        strengths of different approaches. I started reading HTML and CSS:
        Design and Build Websites by Jon Duckett and also purchased his book
        JavaScript and JQuery: Interactive Front-End Web Development to read
        next. I enrolled in Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy,
        but I haven't started it yet. I considered some real-deal coding
        bootcamps, but ultimately decided they're not for me -- I think the
        major benefit for me would be accountability, so my personal decision
        fell between spending ~$15k dollars or building discipline. I chose
        the second.</p>

        to code? How did you decide what to focus on?</aside>

      <h3>oh, networking</h3>
      <p>You know what I've always hated? NETWORKING. Even just hearing the
        term makes me tense up with anxiety. But why? I met with some people
        yesterday and had some good professional conversations, and that felt
        fine. That was networking. So that got me thinking -- what is it about
        networking that I don't like? I spent my hour-long car ride home
        thinking about it. Here's what I concluded:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I hate schmoozing, pretending to care about things I don't care
          about, and pretending to be someone I'm not. It goes against my
          conscience.</li>
        <li>Networking has always seemed to be the epitome of those things --
          everyone walks around and feigns interest in each other's
          constructed images, ultimately just trying to get jobs. (Ew.)</li>
        <li>But, I think I'm (finally) realizing... networking is not those
          things. It has only seemed to be that because I have yet to
          approach one of these situations being confident in who I am and
          what I do. It's felt fake because, well, I've faked it. And I've
          assumed everyone else has been doing the same.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The idea of networking with people when I can clearly, honestly,
        and confidently show who I am and what I do (which comes with
        sincerely having a passion for my work) is -- dare I say it? --
        exciting. I love learning from and about people, but hate feeling
        like I have ulterior motives. Since I'm not currently seeking
        employment, I naturally feel free to learn and listen without any
        other factors muddying up the waters, which is liberating. I like
        the path I'm on right now. It feels good to be growing & learning,
        and I can look forward to sharing what I'm doing and why I'm doing
        it with others. Eventually, I do need to become more comfortable
        with self-promotion (I know it's important for professional
        development, finding jobs, etc.), but for now, I'm going to soak
        up as much of this just-learn-from-others phase as I can.</p>
      <aside>Networking side note: I sincerely
        want to surround myself with people who inspire me and who I can learn
        from and/or alongside. I'd especially like to connect with web
        development (or related career) professionals as well as fellow web
        dev students. If that's you, please contact me!)</aside>

      <h3>~first post~</h3>
      <p>It's a blog! I've never been a blogger before, so this is fun.
        And weirdly a little bit scary? Even talking about something as
        seemingly impersonal as web development, it feels uncomfortably
        exposing to type out my thoughts for the whole world to see. (Well,
        let's be real -- not going to be the highest traffic site on the web,
        but still. It's out there. For anyone.) That being said: welcome,
        reader! This is going to be a medium for me to share what I am
        learning as I teach myself web development.</p>
      <p>There are a few hopes I have for the purpose of this blog. Firstly,
        it is for myself. It's a means of accountability, a way to see my
        progress over time, and a way to build my knowledge in a visual way to
        reflect the knowledge I'll be building mentally. Visual aides are fun,
        right? Now, if that's the only way this blog ends up being used --
        great! It will have met its purpose. But if, for some reason, someone
        else ends up reading it, I could see a few additional ways this mental
        log could be useful. Perhaps a fellow learner could learn from my
        successes and failures to influence their own learning process. Maybe
        a future employer (if that's you, hello from my past self!) can use it
        to verify my dedication, competences, and unique skills. No matter
        how this pans out, it's bound to be an adventure.</p>
