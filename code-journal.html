            One year ago I had never coded and thought Ruby was only a precious stone. However, I was tired of my job and felt like it was a dead-end. Looking around for new jobs, I found that many of the jobs that sounded interesting required some knowledge of programming languages. This is what started me on my journey to Ada.
        </p>

        <p>
            The first six weeks of Ada were devoted to learning Ruby. It is an understatement to say that I felt like I was being firehosed. Ada is a demanding and fast-paced program...doing it with a 1 year old has felt like Niagra Falls. Somehow, I survived the first unit of Ruby with a somewhat slippery grasp of classes.

            Our last week was dedicated to learning HTML and CSS speed-dating style. It has been a nice change of scenery after Ruby and before Ruby on Rails. The extent of my knowledge in this subject is displyed here, in this website.
        </p>

        <p>
            On Monday we start Ruby on Rails. To me, Ruby on Rails just sounds like Ruby, but faster (wasn't Niagra Falls of Ruby fast enough?). I realize this is not at all what it means, so I'm eager to find out what it really is!
